            At Alcatraz, a prisoner had four rights: food, clothing, shelter, 
            and medical care. Everything else was a privilege that had to be earned. 
            Some privileges a prisoner could earn included working, corresponding with and 
            visits from family members, access to the prison library, and recreational activities 
            such as painting and music. source:<a href="https://www.alcatrazhistory.com/famous.htm">
