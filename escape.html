        Assigned to adjoining cells, they began hatching a plan to escape. Morris, 
        known for his intelligence, took the lead in the planning. They were aided by 
        another inmate, Allen West. On June 12, 1962, the routine early morning bed check turned out to be anything but. 
        Three convicts were not in their cells: John Anglin, his brother Clarence, and Frank Morris. In their beds were cleverly built 
        dummy heads made of plaster, flesh-tone paint, and real human hair that apparently fooled the night guards. The prison went into 
        lock down, and an intensive search began. source:<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/alcatraz-escape">FBI</a>
