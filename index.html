     <p>The name Alcatraz is derived from the Spanish "Alcatraces." In 1775, 
        the Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala was the first to sail into what is now known as 
        San Francisco Bay - his expedition mapped the bay and named one of the three islands Alcatraces. 
        Over time, the name was Anglicized to Alcatraz. While the exact meaning is still debated, 
        Alcatraz is usually defined as meaning "pelican" or "strange bird." source:<a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/history/alcatraz.jsp">
